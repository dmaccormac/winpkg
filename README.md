# C Sharp branch (legacy)



# Packaging tool for Windows

The aim of the project is to provide a command line tool to quickly build software installation packages for Windows.

It can be used as a utility to manage ad hoc application installations or as an installer wrapper for software deployments.
    
The project is built using C# and is designed to be portable, compact and fast. It can generate installers that are less than 1KB in size.

# Download
You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/dmaccormac/winpkg/releases). 

The release executable is targeted for Windows x64 and .NET 8.0.

The source code is available in the project repository [here](https://github.com/dmaccormac/winpkg).

# Usage 
The application executable `winpkg.exe` can be used from the desktop or the command line. 

It does not require installation or administrative privileges. 

The installer performs the following actions: 
- Install application to user's Apps folder
- Create an uninstaller for the application
- Register environment variables (PATH)
- Create application shortcuts 

## From the desktop
Drag and drop your application folder onto the winpkg executable.

## From the command line
Provide the application folder path as an argument to winpkg:

`winpkg c:\install\foobar`

## Software deployment
The batch file version `winpkg.cmd` is suitable for distribution with application files due to its framework agnostic design and small file size. 

# Documentation
To view help on the command line, run winpkg without arguments.
